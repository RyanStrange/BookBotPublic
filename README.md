# BookBotPublic
Camosun BookBot 

This is a powershell script and C program I developed with some friends in first year of my Engineering Transfer Program at Camosun College.

We have all since moved to UVic, and this script serves no purpose for us anymore.

The C program is intended to run 24/7 on one of our home servers, calling the appropriate script as soon as the bookings for that day become available.

We had scripts for every day of the week, however only the friday script is shown here, with names, student numbers, and passwords removed. The original code is in a private repository and has not been touched since March 2023.

The scripts havent been run since spring 2023, and most likely dont work anymore unless the camosun study room booking website is exactly the same as before.

To find the correct button inputs, we manually counted the number of tabs, enters, and character inputs.

This process would be much more simplified with something like Selenium, which is something we discussed implementing for a refactor of our project.


Thanks for reading, this project was one of the first things that made me fall in love with coding, and was a huge factor in me choosing Software Engineering over Mech or Elec!
